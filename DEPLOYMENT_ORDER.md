# 🚀 Deployment Order: Infrastructure First

## 📋 Correct Deployment Sequence

### 1. **Database Setup (Supabase)** - REQUIRED FIRST
- [ ] Create Supabase account
- [ ] Create new project
- [ ] Get database connection string
- [ ] Test database connection locally

### 2. **Storage Setup (Wasabi)** - REQUIRED SECOND
- [ ] Create Wasabi account
- [ ] Create bucket for media files
- [ ] Get access credentials
- [ ] Test file upload/download

### 3. **Backend Deployment (Render)** - AFTER INFRASTRUCTURE
- [ ] Set environment variables with real values
- [ ] Deploy backend
- [ ] Test API endpoints

### 4. **Frontend Deployment (Vercel)** - LAST
- [ ] Deploy frontend
- [ ] Connect to backend
- [ ] Test full application

## 🔧 Quick Setup Commands

### Supabase Database Setup
```bash
# 1. Go to supabase.com and create project
# 2. Get connection string from Settings → Database
# 3. Test locally:
node backend/test-db.js
```

### Wasabi Storage Setup
```bash
# 1. Go to wasabi.com and create account
# 2. Create bucket (e.g., "movie-web-media")
# 3. Get credentials from Access Keys
# 4. Test locally:
node backend/test-wasabi.js
```

## ⚠️ Why This Order Matters

1. **Backend needs DATABASE_URL** - Must connect to real database
2. **Backend needs Wasabi credentials** - Must upload files to cloud storage
3. **Frontend needs backend URL** - Must connect to deployed API

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up Supabase** (5 minutes)
2. **Set up Wasabi** (5 minutes)
3. **Deploy backend** with real environment variables
4. **Deploy frontend** and connect everything
